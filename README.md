# Project: updated-portfolio-page

For this project, i was responsible for updating or creating a new portfolio which included past completed projects (as if to be used for actual job hunting)
​
## Getting Started
​
As with most projects, i began with creating the needed files which included an index.html, a stlye.css and a script.js.

I started with the index.html, writing out from scratch all the framework basics of the HTML such as the containers, textareas, buttons and displays. I was sure to assign classes along with some unique IDs for areas that i anticipated would require more changes or content later on. This stage of building is typically the easiest but also holds great importance for the overall project's design. It gives the developer a strong sense of how the project is going to look, function and the purpose it will serve.

Next i began looking into outside design APIs such as Bootstrap but, through a classmate, discovered Materialize. To be completely honest, I used this for really only one feature and that was the unique fade-in, fade-out scrolling carousel.

Sadly, this design choice was completely impractical in the overall scheme when considering how many issues and complications it caused.
* The resizing of the display or images didn't work at all.
* The carousel had a strange invisible border that covered over the functionality of other features such as buttons.
* And it didn't respond well to other css features/methods such as fadeIn/fadeOut or altering visibility and display (it would break completely).

..in fact, it didn't respond well to any css changes, especially those made in javascript.

Looking back, i was far too stubborn and spent way more time on making this work than i should have. Especially when it came to adding the feature for the background and coloring to change with the seasons. This caused multiple complications throughout and i ultimately had to abandon it for now as i couldn't justify dedicating literally DAYS on a feature that the profile viewer would likely never even notice. I will likely return to it though, possibly when i have time to spare as i really enjoy the concept.
